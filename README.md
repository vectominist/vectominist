### Hi! I'm Heng-Jui Chang! 👋

I'm a first-year EECS Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT CSAIL</a> 
in the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/sls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spoken Language Systems Group</a>
advised by Dr. <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jrg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim Glass</a>.
                
I graduated from <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Taiwan University</a> 
in 2021 with my B.S. in Electrical Engineering, and I was supervised by
Prof. <a href="http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lin-shan Lee</a>
and Prof. <a href="https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hung-yi Lee</a>.

💡 I'm interested in machine learning and speech processing.  
🔍 I'm currently working on self-supervised learning and multimodal representation learning.
