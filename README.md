### Hi! I'm Heng-Jui Chang! 👋

I'm a research assistant at the National Taiwan University (NTU) Speech Processing and Machine Learning Lab supervised by Prof. <a href="https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hung-yi Lee</a> and Prof. <a href="https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lin-shan Lee</a>.

💡 I'm interested in machine learning and speech processing.  
🔍 I'm currently working on self-supervised learning and multimodal representation learning.  
🎓 I'll start doing a Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT EECS</a> under <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jrg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Jim Glass's</a> supervision this fall!
